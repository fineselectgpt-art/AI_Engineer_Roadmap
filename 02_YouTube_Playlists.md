## pandas (highly recommended)

### Corey Schafer - Pandas Tutorials (playlist)
- Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS
- Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g

**How to use it (bootcamp style)**
- Create a folder `pandas_labs/`
- After each video, implement one small lab:
  - a CSV load + quick EDA
  - a filter + groupby
  - a join between two tables
  - a pivot table
  - time series resampling

**Minimum output**
- 8 labs total, each in its own notebook or script.

## NumPy (full beginner course + extras)

### freeCodeCamp channel (lots of full courses)
- Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp

### freeCodeCamp NumPy learning article (with video context)
- Article: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/numpy-python-tutorial/

**Bootcamp drill (must-do)**
- Rebuild common operations without looking:
  - vectorized math (no loops)
  - boolean masking
  - `reshape`, `transpose`
  - broadcasting example (add a column vector to a matrix)

## How to watch YouTube without wasting time

Use this loop:

1. Watch 5-10 minutes
2. Pause
3. Code 15-30 minutes
4. Write a 3-bullet recap

If you can’t code it, you don’t know it yet.
