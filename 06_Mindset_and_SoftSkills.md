# 🧠 06 — Mindset & Soft Skills (How Engineers Actually Win)

Technical skill gets you interviews.  
Soft skill gets you hired and promoted.

---

## 6.1 Communication That Makes You “Senior”

### Write like an engineer
- “What I changed” (summary)
- “Why I changed it” (reason)
- “How to verify it” (tests/run steps)

### In every PR / commit
- small, focused changes
- clear commit messages
- explain tradeoffs without drama

> ✅ **Rule:** If your teammate can’t reproduce your result, it doesn’t exist.

---

## 6.2 Collaboration Habits

- Use issues for tasks
- Keep PRs small
- Ask for review early
- Give review respectfully

### Inclusive engineering behaviors
- avoid jargon when possible; define terms
- ask “what would make this easier for a new person?”
- write docs for future you
- respect accessibility and user diversity

---

## 6.3 Thinking in Constraints (The Real Job)

In production, you optimize for:
- latency
- reliability
- cost
- privacy
- safety
- fairness

> 💡 **Engineering is choosing tradeoffs intentionally.**

---

## 6.4 Debugging Mindset

When a model performs poorly:
1. verify data split + leakage
2. verify labels are correct
3. create a dumb baseline
4. run error analysis
5. change one thing at a time

When training breaks:
- check shapes
- check learning rate
- overfit a tiny subset (sanity test)
- log everything

---

## 6.5 Consistency > Motivation

A good routine beats hype.

**Minimum weekly outputs**
- 3 code sessions
- 1 evaluation report update
- 1 README improvement
- 1 public progress artifact (post, demo, screenshot)

---

## 6.6 How To Get Feedback

- post progress with a clear ask (“Can someone review my README?”)
- share small, concrete questions
- keep a “feedback backlog” and implement it

---

## Checkpoint

- [ ] I write READMEs that explain my decisions  
- [ ] I can collaborate using issues/PRs  
- [ ] I can describe constraints and tradeoffs clearly  
- [ ] I have a consistent weekly routine
