# 🗺️ 03 — Learning Roadmap (Week‑by‑Week)

You have two tracks:

- **6‑Month Fast‑Track:** intense, project‑heavy
- **9‑Month Standard:** more repetition + deeper fundamentals

Both tracks ship the same portfolio, with different pacing.

---

## Milestones (Same For Both Tracks)

1. **ML Foundations Project** shipped (baseline + evaluation)
2. **Deep Learning Project** shipped (PyTorch)
3. **LLM/RAG Project** shipped (vector search + UI/API)
4. **Deployed AI App** shipped (Docker + cloud)
5. **Job‑ready package** (resume, LinkedIn, interview practice)

---

## Track A — 6‑Month Fast‑Track (24 Weeks)

### Weeks 1–4: Foundations Sprint
**Focus:** Python, pandas, SQL, baseline ML

**Deliverables**
- 20 SQL queries repo
- baseline classifier with scikit‑learn
- one polished README

### Weeks 5–8: Machine Learning Sprint
**Focus:** features, model selection, evaluation, pipelines

**Deliverables**
- regression project + error analysis
- classification project + thresholding
- experiment report template used

### Weeks 9–12: Deep Learning Sprint
**Focus:** PyTorch fundamentals + one serious model

**Deliverables**
- image classifier (or NLP classifier)
- training curves + overfitting mitigation

### Weeks 13–16: LLM Apps Sprint
**Focus:** embeddings, vector search, RAG, evaluation

**Deliverables**
- RAG app with citations/sources
- prompt and retrieval experiments

### Weeks 17–20: Deployment + MLOps Sprint
**Focus:** FastAPI, Docker, CI, cloud deploy, monitoring basics

**Deliverables**
- Dockerized API deployed (Render/Fly/Cloud Run/etc.)
- CI pipeline running tests

### Weeks 21–24: Job Readiness Sprint
**Focus:** portfolio polish + interviews

**Deliverables**
- 3 major repos polished
- resume + STAR stories
- mock interview loop

---

## Track B — 9‑Month Standard (36 Weeks)

Same milestones, but each sprint includes:
- more drills
- more reading
- more repetition
- 2 extra mini‑projects (for confidence)

---

## Weekly Structure (Use Every Week)

### Monday
- plan tasks + define metric/deliverable
- create GitHub issue list

### Tuesday–Thursday
- implement + test
- push commits daily

### Friday
- refactor + documentation
- run evaluation and save report

### Saturday
- demo + deploy if possible
- write short post / reflection

### Sunday
- review and reset

---

## Recommended Daily Split (If You Have 2 Hours)

- 30m: learning (video/book)
- 60m: build (code)
- 30m: polish (tests/README/reflection)

---

## Checkpoint: Are You On Track?

Every 4 weeks, answer:
- Can I demo something working?
- Can I explain metrics and tradeoffs?
- Did I write at least one test?
- Did I improve a baseline with evidence?

If you can’t demo, you’re studying too much and building too little.

---

## Optional “Career Parallel Track” (Start Week 6)

- Update LinkedIn weekly
- Post 1 project update every 2 weeks
- Network with 2 people/week (messages, meetups, communities)
- Track jobs to learn requirements early

> ✅ This makes interviews easier because you’re already speaking employer language.
