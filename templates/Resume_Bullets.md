# Resume Bullet Templates (AI Engineer)

Use: Action + Tech + Result + Context

Examples:
- Built a scikit-learn pipeline for churn prediction (AUC 0.86), adding leak-safe preprocessing and segmented evaluation to reduce false positives for high-value customers.
- Deployed a Dockerized FastAPI inference service with CI tests (GitHub Actions), enabling reproducible runs and reducing onboarding time for new contributors.
- Implemented a RAG chatbot using embeddings + FAISS, returning cited sources and cutting time-to-answer for internal docs searches.

Tips:
- Always include **metric** (accuracy, AUC, MAE, latency, cost, time saved).
- Mention **deployment** and **tests** whenever you can.
