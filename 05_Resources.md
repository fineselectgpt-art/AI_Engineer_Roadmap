# 📚 05 — Resources (Courses, Books, Platforms)

This is a curated resource list you can use without getting lost.  
Pick **one primary** resource per topic, then supplement only when stuck.

## 5.1 Courses (Structured Paths)

### Machine Learning
- Coursera: **Machine Learning Specialization** (Andrew Ng)
- Google: Machine Learning Crash Course (fast + practical)

### Deep Learning
- DeepLearning.AI: Deep Learning Specialization (conceptual)
- fast.ai: Practical Deep Learning for Coders (build fast)

### LLMs
- Hugging Face: Transformers Course
- “RAG” tutorials (HF, LangChain, LlamaIndex ecosystems)

### MLOps / Deployment
- Full Stack Deep Learning (end‑to‑end systems)
- MLOps Zoomcamp (project‑driven)

> 💡 Pick based on your learning style:
> - **theory‑heavy:** DeepLearning.AI  
> - **build‑heavy:** fast.ai / FSDL / Zoomcamp

## 5.2 Books (Keep A Short Shelf)

### Practical ML
- *Hands‑On Machine Learning with Scikit‑Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* (Géron)

### Deep Learning
- *Deep Learning with Python* (Chollet)

### Python/Data
- *Python Data Science Handbook* (VanderPlas)

### Systems Thinking (Optional)
- *Designing Data‑Intensive Applications* (Kleppmann) — for strong engineering instincts

---

## 5.3 Practice Platforms

- Kaggle (datasets + notebooks + competitions)
- Hugging Face Hub (models + datasets)
- Papers with Code (see SOTA and implementations)

---

## 5.4 Math/Stats References (Practical)

- Khan Academy (targeted refresh)
- 3Blue1Brown (linear algebra intuition)
- StatQuest (statistics and ML intuition)

---

## 5.5 Cloud + DevOps Learning

- AWS Skill Builder (foundations)
- Docker docs + tutorials
- GitHub Actions docs

---

## 5.6 Communities (Accountability + Feedback)

- local meetups (data/AI/ML groups)
- open source communities
- Discord/Slack learning groups

> ✅ The fastest growth comes from building in public and getting feedback.

---

## Suggested “Resource Stack” (Minimal)

If you want a simple default path:
1. Andrew Ng ML course (structure)
2. Géron book (hands‑on reference)
3. fast.ai or PyTorch tutorials (deep learning)
4. FSDL or Zoomcamp (end‑to‑end / MLOps)
5. Hugging Face course (LLMs)

## Checkpoint

- [ ] I picked one primary resource per major topic  
- [ ] I have a weekly routine for practice projects  
- [ ] I know where to go when I’m stuck (docs + communities)
