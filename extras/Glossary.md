# Glossary (AI Engineer)

- **Baseline:** The simplest model that sets a minimum performance bar.
- **Data leakage:** Training data accidentally contains information that wouldn’t be available at prediction time.
- **Distribution shift:** Production data differs from training data, causing performance drops.
- **Ablation:** Remove one change to see if it actually mattered.
- **RAG:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation: retrieve relevant documents, then generate an answer grounded in them.
- **Embedding:** Vector representation of text/images used for similarity search.
- **Vector database:** Stores embeddings for fast nearest-neighbor search.
- **MLOps:** Practices/tools that make ML systems reproducible, deployable, and maintainable.
