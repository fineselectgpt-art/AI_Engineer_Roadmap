# 📘 AI Engineer Bootcamp Mini‑Ebook (Markdown)

A bootcamp‑style, hands‑on curriculum designed to take a self‑taught developer from “comfortable with coding” to **hire‑ready AI Engineer** through a portfolio of production‑style projects.

**Recommended pace:** 6–9 months (adjustable).  
**Study time target:** 10–15 hrs/week (minimum), 20+ hrs/week (fast‑track).  
**Format:** Read → build → ship → reflect.

---

## What You’ll Be Able To Do By The End

- Build ML + DL models with **scikit‑learn** and **PyTorch**
- Evaluate models properly (metrics, bias checks, error analysis)
- Ship AI features behind APIs with **FastAPI**
- Containerize + deploy with **Docker**, **CI/CD**, and a cloud provider
- Build an **LLM app** with retrieval (vector search) and a simple UI
- Communicate clearly with READMEs, diagrams, experiment notes, and demos

## How To Use This Ebook

1. Start with **00_Getting_Started.md** to set up your environment.
2. Follow the **03_Learning_Roadmap.md** weekly plan.
3. Build the portfolio in **04_Projects_and_Portfolio.md**.
4. Treat each “Sprint” as a mini‑deadline. Ship something every week.

> ✅ **Rule of thumb:** Every week should produce a commit, a screenshot/demo, and a short reflection.

## Setup (Quick)

### Python environment (choose one)

**Option A — `venv` (simple)**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
python -m pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option B — Conda (cleaner for data/ML)**
```bash
conda create -n ai-bootcamp python=3.11 -y
conda activate ai-bootcamp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Tools you’ll use
- **VS Code** (or your editor)
- **Git + GitHub**
- **Jupyter** (notebooks for exploration)
- **Docker** (deployment + reproducibility)

## Assessment (Bootcamp Style)

Each major sprint ends with:
- ✅ A **repo** with clean structure
- ✅ A **README** with problem → solution → results
- ✅ A **demo** (gif/video or hosted app)
- ✅ A short **experiment report** (what you tried + what worked)

> 🎯 **Passing standard:** You can explain decisions, tradeoffs, metrics, and next steps like an engineer — not just “it runs.”
